This project is a very basic recipe website which contains links to multiple recipes. This project is done as part of The Odin Project's foundation course
The skills demonstrated in this project is basic HTML and the use of multiple tags.

After learning CSS, I revisited the project(as part of The Odin Project's instruction) and changed it up slightly.
The things added in this project are colour changes, centering and image resizing.
